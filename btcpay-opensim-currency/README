###Compiling
1. Compile OpenSim.
2. Place the "btcpay-opensim-currency" in the OpenSimulator source root folder.
+ In Windows, run or double click:
# opensim-0.9.3-source\btcpay-opensim-currency\runprebuild.bat
This will create the solution and produce a compile.bat files... run or double click:
# opensim-0.9.3-source\btcpay-opensim-currency\compile.bat
A successful compilation will add a "bin" folder inside "btcpay-opensim-currency" with the target sub-folder "net8.0" where you will find the Money Server executable and the module DLLs...
# opensim-0.9.3-source\btcpay-opensim-currency\bin\net8.0\

+ In Linux&Co, is the same as Windows but the file extension is .sh
 # cd opensim-0.9.3-source

The following values are used to check the origin and the HMAC of the incoming notifications and are sensive data.
To get your Webhook ID and Secret password, click your store "Settings" in the left menu > Webhooks, create a new webhook and set the full URL of the webhook.php file eg;
https://your-domain-or-ip.here/helper_scripts/helper/webhook.php
When done click "Modify" and copy your webhook ID from the URL in the browser address bar, the ID is the last value in the URL (after the last /) eg;
https://YourBTCPayDomainName.here/stores/FzeG58ybj2hU9XEkNEz8NqPrJq8LAtYXvZ5MEqfg6gT6/webhooks/HwR1T6LKgJkZkbNUvKj41N

/* BTCPay get the rates and calculate in real time the equivalent of the your fiat prices in crypto based the following settings:
- BTCPAY_FIAT : The fiat ticker or symbol in uppercase eg; USD EUR GBP CAD... (Fiat only here!). This value depends on the availabilty of the fiat currency in the rates data provider that you can get and set in your store "Settings" > Rates.
- BTCPAY_PAYMENT_CRYPTOCURRENCY : The cryptocurrency ticker or symbol in uppercase that you want to recive as payment eg; LTC, DOGE, XMR, BTC... (Cryptos only here!)
NOTE: Not all the cryptocurrencies prices are adapted to the micro-payments and BTCPay supports only few ones... so, we are limited to the this list:
https://docs.btcpayserver.org/FAQ/Altcoin/

Recommanded: 
- Dogecoin (DOGE): adapted value/price for the hypergrid economy and available in the majority of exchanges... DOGE do some surprises time to time like x2 (or /2!) in the rates.
- Monero (XMR): For privacy and a low ecological impact comparing with many others like Bitcoin. Also Monero is a CPU only minable coin, so you can setup a Monero miner aside your opensim and/or BTCPay instance and mine Monero when there is nobody inWorld...*/
